# Cpp-Project- Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a C++ program designed to manage employee records within an organization. This menu-driven application allows users to add, update, delete, and search for employee information. The system stores details such as employee ID, name, position, department, and salary. At the start, there are no records, so users must add employee data using the available menu options.
